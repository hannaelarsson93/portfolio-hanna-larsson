        <h1 class="project-head">Increasing customer loyalty</h1>
        <p>
          H&M Group consists of several brands. All of the H&M brands see it as
          a key priority to attract young female customers (age 16-22). In
          today's fashion industry it is very difficult for brands to go from
          transactional relationship with customers to true, long lasting
          engagement.
        </p>

        <p>
          The usual ways for brands to try to achieve this goal of long lasting relations is by offering
          memberships and clubs that reward consumers with discounts. However, this
          might not be the only way to achieve customer loyalty. There are other
          ways to create emotional bonds with intended customers. That is where me and my teammates helped H&M Group!

        <p>
          Me and my team received a brief from H&M Group during our
          course in Human-centered Design at Hyper Island. The challenge was to present an idea
          for a new digital product or service that solved identified customer
          needs and had the ability to create long lasting engagement with girls
          aged 16-22.

        <p>
          Research was conducted to better understand the target group of young
          girls age 16-22 and their behaviors as well as problems/pain-points. I
          created a survey and we sent it out to validate our hypotheses and gain more insights on the target group. We also conducted interviews to
          gather data on the customers. One of the respondents
          was a known instagram influencer interviewed to get the perspective
          of a 'super user'.
        </p>
        <p>
          The method used for analysis of the result for both the survey and the
          interviews was identifying patterns, similarities and themes.

          When analyzing the results from the interviews and survey we found
          some recurring themes. 
        </p>

        <h2 class="heading-6">Why do the target group go shopping?</h2>
        <p>
          The target group generally go shopping when there is a new season, they are
          going to an event or party, or they need something specific. They also
          go shopping because they have seen someone wearing something in social
          media that they also would like to have.

      </div>
      <div class="text-vertical">
        <h2 class="heading-6">What is the target groups view of prices?</h2>
        <p>
          The target group consider price to be the most important when
          shopping. The target group wants to shop trendy pieces to good prices. In other words; clothes should look expensive, but be cheap.

        <h2 class="heading-6">
          From where or who does the target group take inspiration?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The target group gets their fashion inspiration mainly from social
          media, people on the street and their friends. The target
          group thinks that mainstream shops are not uniqe enough and that fahsion
          brands need to include a wider variety och people and looks.

          Do the target group care about sustainability?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The target group thinks that following trends is still the most
          important even though they are concious of sustainability. Young girls
          want to buy more sustainable, but often cannot afford it. Young girls do
          not want to compromise their wardrobe for sustainability and would
          rather take other actions for the planet.

        </h2>
        <p>
          The target group does to a large extent consider what they already
          have at home before buying new things. They are concious to make sure
          the new pieces matches what they already have in their closet. Young
          girls feel guilty when buying clothes "just because" and they also
          cannot afford this.

        <h2 class="h2-7">Problem statement & How might we..</h2>
        <h1 class="project-head-3">Defining the need</h1>
        <p>
          From the research insights a problem statement was formulated in
          relations to sustainability & purchase power. The problem statement
          formulated was; eventhough the target group care about sustainability,
          young girls still buy clothes they don't use for a long time, only
          because it's trendy and cheap (and they feel bad about it).
        </p>

        <p>
          From this, several "How might we.." were generated. Finally, one "How
          might we.." was chosen and ideated on: 
        </p>
        <ul class="deliver">
          <li>How might we make it easier for young girls to buy smarter?</li>

        <h3 id="ideation" class="project-head">Ideation</h3>
        <p>
          From the "How might we.." we ideated on different solutions to the
          problems and needs identified in the research. We used several different methods when ideating, such as "100 ideas in 1 one hour" and "crazy 8". 
        </p>
        <img class="img-ideas" src="project_pictures/ideation-session.png" alt="xxxxx" />
        <p class="explain">
          In total we had over 100 ideas. We evalutaed every idea on the risk x value matrix.

          matrix.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end we choose to move forward with the idea of creating a
          application that would help users have a better overview of their
          closet based on the concept of a <i>curated closet</i>.

        <p>
          When the brief was presented to us by H&M Group they wanted us to
          choose one brand in their brand portfolio to target. We choose to
          target our solution for the H&M Divided brand, since in the Divided collections there are a very
          broad range of clothes, which was a good fit for our solution.

The user flow guided us in creating the screens for each step that the user could go throught in their journey within the app.

        <h1 class="project-head-3">Adding pieces</h1>
        <p>We designed three ways for users to add items into their closets, making it as convenient as possible for the user to add clothes into their closet. The first (1) way for the users to add pieces to their closets is by taking a photo of the piece of clothing. The background of the image will automatically be removed once the photo is taken. The second (2) way of uploading a piece is for the user to upload a photo from their mobile camera. The third (3) and final way for the user to upload a piece of clothing is by pasting a link from the H&M website. In this case the image is generated from H&M's website. After the user uploaded the piece they sort it into a category, color, type and season.</p>

      <p>Assorted will create better relationships with girls in the target group, which will result in them buying from H&M when they shop.

      <p>
        Customers will buy smarter, which means less waste of resources. Customers will wear their pieces of clothes on more occasions (instead of only once or twice) because of the aid in matching from the app. The solution drives change in customer mindset towards sustainability.

    </p>

    <!-- list of future things that can be included in the app (solution) -->
    <ul class="deliver">
      <li class="change">
        Scale to all H&M brands - We want the users to be able to scroll through all of H&M’s brands. Therefore we would add all the brands in Assorted as a future feature, to be able to give the users a wider selection of options and to eventually also attract other age groups. 
      </li>
      <li class="change">
        In-app shopping - We also want to add an in-app shopping-tool for the users to be able to shop their wishlists directly from the app.
      </li>
      <li class="change">
        Social media - The target group considers social media as one of their biggest interests. One idea that we have for Assorted is to add a social media-twist to it and make it into a social platform. The users would be able to share their boards within the app and they would also be able to scroll through others boards on an “explore”-feed and get inspired by other users boards and wardrobes.
