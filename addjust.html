        <p>
          Equality is a very important topic. Equality is a human right. We are
          all entitled to live with dignity and
          with the freedom of self expression
          without fear. These rights should
          apply for people of all genders, sexual
          orientations, beliefs, ethnicities or any
          other individual in a minority.
        </p>

        <p>
          It’s a known fact that women in general spend more time doing unpaid work such as taking care of children, laundry, cleaning and preparing meals. This creates inequalities.

        <p>
          I decided to join the Creative Conscience challenge. Creative Conscience is a creative community and global not-for-profit organisation who believe that creative thinking and innovation can make positive change. There were severals briefs. I chose to work with the brief that addressed the topic of <i>equality</i>. The challenge was to think of a way to change current behaviours and inspire people to understand the value brought by treating everyone equally. The  brief challanged the participants to think
          of a way to actively change human behaviour and understanding.

          I completed the brief in 3 weeks during a module in Hyper Island called Professional path, where students are expected to plan their own time and work independently. I wanted to spend my time creating something that had an impact and the possibility to make the world a better place. Therefore i joined the challenge and brief given by Creative Conscience, which is a yearly design competition that aims to generate solutions that helps the planet & society.

        <p>
         I dug deeper into the theme of equality to see what problems existed in this area. I mainly conducted desktop reserach in order to find insights on problems and needs when it came to equality. I quickly found insights that there seemed to exist large equality problems connected to household work. Some of the insights I found was that according to UN Women, women in general carry out at least 2,5 times more household work than men. This results in women having less time to engage in paid labor, or they work longer hours to combine paid and unpaid labor.

        <p>
          Due to Covid lockdowns people are home more than ever. This means need for care and household work has multiplied. With data from 38 countries UN Women have concluded that both women and men had increased unpaid workload. However, women are still taking on a larger portion than men. More women than men are leaving the workforce, perhaps as a result of the increased unpaid workloads.

        <p>
          When I had pin-pointed the problems realted to equality in the household, and decided that this was the area I wanted to focus on, I formulated a "How might we.." to spark ideas for a solution.

        <p>
          I ideated and came up with different solutions. From this point on I had started to get a clear view of what type of solution I wanted to create in order to solve or aid the problems and needs I previously had found. I considered only one idea to be good enough to move on with and develop a concept and prototype for.
        <p>
          In the end I choose to move forward with the idea of creating a concept for an
          application that would help users track their household work for a more <i>equal</i> every day life.

        <p>
          Addjust is the app that lets you add some just to the unpaid work in your relationship. By using Addjust you can easily track the household work that has been done and what chores need to be done next. All for a more equal everyday life! 
        </p>
        <p>
          Addjust lets you invite people to your household and add chores to your household list. Each chore gives different points if you complete it depending on its category. Of course,  there is also a scoreboard to see who is in the lead.   
        </p>
        <p>
          The process of completing chores has been gamified and there are rewards, which you set yourself, to be had when you collected the points you set out to do.
