        <p>
         My name is Hanna Larsson and I am currently studying Digital Media Creative at Hyper Island. At Hyper Island I am learning the latest trends in design, technology, strategy and entrepreneurship, all with a focus on creativity and communication for the digital world. During my education I have led and participated in projects regarding Human-centered Design, UX design & Development. In both projects I gained knowledge of user behavior and conducted user research together with my teammates. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Since before I have a degree in international business and I also have a background from working as management consultant. As a consultant i worked both in project management and with change management. I loved the human interactions. However, I always felt drawn to tech, design and the amazing things that can be achieved with these.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of this i started my journey to become a UX Designer in the fall 2020 and I can't wait to continue.
