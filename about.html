        <p>
         My name is Hanna Larsson and I am currently studying Digital Media Creative at Hyper Island. At Hyper Island I am learning the latest trends in design, technology, strategy and entrepreneurship, all with a focus on creativity and communication for the digital world. During my education I have led and participated in projects regarding UX Design and Development. In all projects I gained knowledge of user behavior and conducted user research together with my teammates. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I have previously completed a degree in international business and I also have a background from working as management consultant. As a consultant i worked both in project management and with change management. I loved the human interactions. However, I always felt drawn to tech, design and the amazing things that can be achieved with these. I am a firm beliver that design should be human-centered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of this I started my journey to become a UX Designer in the fall of 2020. On this site I will share interesting projects and case studies of projects I have been working on. I can't wait to continue my journey and I hope that you want to follow along!
