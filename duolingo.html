        <p>
          Duolingo is the world’s #1 language learning app – used by hundreds of millions of learners around the world. The benefits of learning another language are exponential, from boosting brain power to reducing global economic inequality.
        </p>
        <p>Duoling was founded on the belief that learning should be fun. In this biref I aimed to open young adults’ eyes to the world of languages and inspire them to weave language learning into their daily routine, with an integrated campaign launching at the start of the school year. </p>

        <p>
          The brief, as given by D&AD - New Blood Awards was to figure out how to put Doulingo in the hands of 16-22 yeard olds all around the globe through an integrated campaign that drives them to download and use Duolingo. By weaving language into their daily routines Duolingo early on, lanuage learning is more likely to stick with them.

        <h3 id="research" class="project-head-5">A day in the life</h3>
        <p>
          Due to that we chose to solve the brief in a sprint-format over only about three days we had limited time for conducting research. However, we managed to do some desktop research & some interviews with family and friends in parallel to our studies before going into the sprint.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the information we gathered we mapped out a "regular" day in the life of a 16-22 year old, which is shown below. For a high-fi version of the map of a regular day, <u><a href="https://www.figma.com/file/56OXCsQo2k671vOOIJ0d8x/Duolingo-Insights?node-id=0%3A1">click here.</a></u> Inside the map of activities we then mapped out where in the day it would fit best for the target audience to have time/be prone to practicing Duolingo.
        </p>
        <p>Lastly, in the mapping of the daily routine we could see three clear touch points where there would be room  for a new habit of Duolingo; <b>(1) In the morning Social media routine just after waking up</b>, <b>(2) communte back and forth to school</b> and <b>(3) the afternoon and evening stream.</b></p>

        <h3 id="ideation" class="project-head">Ideation</h3>
        <p>
          We ideated using and came up with different solutions to the brief. The solution that we chose to move forward with was an integrated campaign that played with words in the quirky way that Duo, the maskot of Duolingo is known for.
          <p>This idea was fitting for the target audience and had potential to get encourage the target audience to learn languages through Duolingo. Since Duolingo is a langauge learning tool we wanted the solution to be language related.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Presentation of the idea (Assorted)  -->
    <div class="description-assorted">
      <div class="text-width">
        <h2 class="h2-7">Our idea</h2>
        <h1 id="prototype" class="project-head-3">Transform yourself</h1>
        <p>
          Duolingo is based on the fundation that learning should be fun. Our campaign reflects this playfulness of the brand by playing with language & words. Each ad is built on the same foundation, and each of them correlates to the differrent touch points we identified in the research.</p>
          <img class="img-middle" src="duolingo/Bilboard.png" alt="A picture of the Acast ads in a bus stop"/>
          <p>Our idea was an integrated campaign tageted to 16-22 year olds where the message was that common habits such as watching Netflix, scrolling while waiting for the bus or suddent energy peaks can be turned into language learning oportunities.
          We use anagrams as a representation of the transformation our target group want to see in themselves. By turning an existing habit into a more valuble one. All while using the quirky (almost passive-aggressive) undertone that Duo is known for.

        <p>Since teens view being knowledgeble as cool we wanted to make the ads really clever and smart! </p>
