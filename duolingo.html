          Duolingo is the world’s #1 language learning app – used by hundreds of millions of learners around the world. The benefits of learning another language are exponential, from boosting brain power to reducing global economic inequality.
        </p>
        <p>Duoling was founded on the belief that learning should be fun. In this biref I aimed to open young adults’ eyes to the world of languages and inspire them to weave language learning into their daily routine, with an integrated campaign launching at the start of the school year. </p>

        <p>
          The brief, as given by D&AD was to figure out how to put Doulingo in the hands of 16-22 yeard olds all around the globe through an integrated campaign that drives them to download and use Duolingo. By weaving language into their daily routines Duolingo early on, lanuage learning is more likely to stick with them.

          Due to that we chose to solve the brief in a sprint-format over only about three days we had limited time for conducting research. However, we managed to do some desktop research & some interviews with family and friends in parallel to our studies before going into the sprint.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the information we gathered we mapped out a "regular" day in the life of a 16-22 year old, which is shown below.

          In the end we choose to move forward with the idea of creating a

          We suggested Acast 3 different options for channels depening on budget contraints.  
            We advised Acast to go with alternative number 2 since this was almost the same cost as alternative 1 but would potentially reach a larger audience.

        <p>
          Focus on social media and ads in podcasts. With this alternative Acast could reach an even larger target audience without spending that much more money since making podcast advertisements are quite cheap for them.

        It is always important to measure the success of a campaign when it is launhced. We suggested Aacast that they could measure leads and conversion from the campaign using a dedicated landing page using UTM links. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In the socail media ads there are clear buttons leading to the sign up page and in the printed ads there are QR-codes included so that the target group easily can scan the code and end up in the sign up page.
